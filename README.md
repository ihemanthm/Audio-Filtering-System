# 🎧 Audio-Filtering System

An AI-powered audio filtering system that isolates the **primary speaker’s voice** and suppresses background noise in real time. Built using **Python**, **PyTorch**, and **Gradio**, this tool supports both audio files and real-time input streams.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎙️ Isolates the primary speaker's voice
- 🔇 Suppresses background noise (e.g., traffic, music, chatter)
- 🧠 Uses CNN-based deep learning models
- 📊 Supports evaluation using SNR, PESQ, and MOS
- 🌐 Includes an interactive Gradio web UI

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihemanthm/Audio-Filtering-System
cd Audio-Filtering-System
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3️⃣ Download Datasets

You'll need:

- **Clean speech**: [Mozilla Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/)
- **Noise samples**: [MUSAN Dataset](https://www.openslr.org/17/)

Place files in a `data/` directory.

---

### 4️⃣ Preprocess Data

Create noisy audio by mixing clean speech with noise:

```bash
python utils/preprocess.py
```

---

### 5️⃣ Train the Model

```bash
python train.py
```

- Trains a CNN denoiser on synthetic noisy audio
- Saves model weights to `cnn_denoiser.pth`

---

### 6️⃣ Denoise New Audio (Inference)

```bash
python infer.py
```

- Input: `test_noisy.wav`
- Output: `cleaned_output.wav`

---

### 7️⃣ Evaluate Performance

```python
from utils import calculate_snr, calculate_pesq

snr = calculate_snr("data/clean.wav", "output/denoised.wav")
pesq = calculate_pesq("data/clean.wav", "output/denoised.wav")

print("SNR:", snr)
print("PESQ:", pesq)
```

---

### 8️⃣ Launch the Gradio UI

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

- Access at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`
- Upload `.wav` file → receive denoised output

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric | Description                              |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| **SNR**  | Signal-to-Noise Ratio (in dB)             |
| **PESQ** | Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality  |
| **MOS**  | Mean Opinion Score (simulated)           |

These help assess how well the model enhances speech quality.
